  Chooses the correct Cloud Labs edge channel for teleop, live video, and
  deliberate work. Use when implementing START_TELEOP, live feed streams,
  WebSockets, OPTIMIZE jobs, or debating HTTP vs stream vs job.

# Latency channels

## Three tiers (all still in the vocabulary)

| Tier | Arm with | Transport | Use for |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| A | `START_TELEOP` | Flat WS frames | Interactive jog / pose |
| B | `START_LIVE_FEED` | JPEG / MJPEG | Preview for the eye |
| C | `POST /execute` / jobs | Request or job stream | Move, record, optimize |

## Do

- Reject nested teleop JSON; keep Tier A payloads tiny.
- Return HTTP 409 on stream URLs until the matching START primitive armed the channel.
- Run long OPTIMIZE loops as **jobs** on the edge (progress stream), not a held HTTP body.
- Stamp time on samples; never pretend live preview is a scientific record.

## Do not

- Do not closed-loop optimize by shipping every frame to a laptop.
- Do not open teleop or video without the arming primitive.
- Do not mix Tier A rates with deep schema validation on every frame.

## Typical files

- `adapters/teleop.py`, `adapters/live_feed.py`, `adapters/optimize.py`, server WS/stream routes, `runtime/jobs.py` if present.
